# Quiz
 
A quiz created as a school assignment with a classmate (hence, all questions and answers are in Dutch, not English). Gaming knowledge required.

Due to time constraints, as well as Python and TkInter being a bitch, we were unable to implement a method to have all questions and answers in one file with transitions from one question to the next. So we split it into five different files instead.
